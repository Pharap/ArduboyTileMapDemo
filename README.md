## Licence

Code is [CC0](https://github.com/Pharap/ArduboyTileMapDemo/blob/master/LICENSE). That means you can do what you like with it. You don't even have to provide credit, though I would be happier if you did.

The tile images are also [CC0](https://github.com/Pharap/ArduboyTileMapDemo/blob/master/LICENSE). I don't have to provide credit for them, but I choose to do so. They were created by drummyfish and can be found [here on Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/content/1bit-graphics-collection), in amongst other tiles and sprites as well as [here](https://community.arduboy.com/t/ardurpg-free-assets-for-arduventure/6133) on the Arduboy forum.
